Log Issues:
(1) Some rescaling on last screen required. Not as responsive to smaller screen sizes - like half width as I would have preferred.
(2) Have to learn how to lazy load resources as and when required. Current method involves rendering all screens at load time and hiding them until required and then transitioning them into the visibility.
Will have to learn async programming at some point in the near future.

Log Wins - 
(1) Learnt transitions in CSS
(2) A lot of DOM manipulation unlike most of the previous projects
(3) Created objects using classes and made them interact with each other.
